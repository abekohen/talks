# Python Brain Teasers

## Description

> Both your title and this description are made public and displayed in the
> conference program to help attendees decide whether they are interested in
> this presentation. Limit this description to a few concise paragraphs.

The Python programming language is a simple one, but like all other languages it has its quirks. This talk uses these quirks as a teaching opportunity.

I'll show some short Python code examples. After each example I'll give the audience some time to guess the output. Then I'll show the actual code output and explain *why* this is the output.

Example:

```python
name = 'Waldo'
text = 'Can you find where Wally is?'

if text.find(name):
    print('Found Waldo')
else:
    print('Cannot find Waldo')
```


## Who and Why (Audience)

> 1–2 paragraphs that should answer three questions: (1) Who is this talk for?
> (2) What background knowledge or experience do you expect the audience to
> have? (3) What do you expect the audience to learn or do after watching the
> talk?

The audience are Python developer who'd like to know more about Python and it's implementation.
The talk require some Python knowledge and after the talk the attendees will (hopefully) gain some new understanding on Python and other technology subjects.

## Level

Beginner

I'm an experienced Python (23+ years) developer and have extensive speaking experience.
