# Having Fun with Data and Pandas

_November 12, 2020 5:30PM BST at codebar.io_

In this walk-through we'll use the Python "pandas" library to analyze taxi trip
records. You're more than welcomed to follow along!

The "pandas" library is *the* library for data processing. You'll learn how to
use it to load data and gain insights from it. We'll answer questions such as:
- Which vendor earned more money?
- What is the average tip percent?
- What is the longest ride?
- ...

We'll also create some pretty graphs and have fun in general.

No Python or math knowledge is required. You do need an open mind and some curiosity.

If you want to follow along, please install the Anaconda Scientific Python distribution from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and download the data file from http://bit.ly/taxi-1m
